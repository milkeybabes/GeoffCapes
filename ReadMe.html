BBC Micro Game - In Memory of Geoff Capes

This repository contains the source code for my first commercial game, written entirely in 6502 assembly language for the BBC Micro Computer. The game is released as a tribute to Geoff Capes, a legendary athlete and two-time World's Strongest Man, who passed away in October 2024. His strength and resilience continue to inspire, and this project is dedicated to honoring his remarkable legacy.

About the Game
This game was one of the earliest projects in my career, reflecting the excitement and ambition of the 8-bit era. It was created to challenge both players' skills and reflexes. It never pushed the boundaries of the BBC, but it was to be different, to go with that track-and-field type keyboard bashing experience.
I'm sorry to anyone who destroyed their computer keyboard playing this.

Code Overview
The source code has minimal comments, as was common in the era, focusing on compactness and time allowances. The code is organized for direct execution on the BBC Micro hardware, so familiarity with 6502 assembly will help understand its flow and logic.

Acknowledgements
With my friend David Wainright, who also helped in some part, honestly, now I don't remember which, this title was only possible. Too many years ago to remember.
