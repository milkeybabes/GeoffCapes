<h1>BBC Micro Game - In Memory of Geoff Capes</h1>

<p>This repository contains the original source code for my first commercial game, written entirely in 6502 assembly language for the BBC Micro Computer. The game is released as a tribute to Geoff Capes, a legendary athlete and two-time World's Strongest Man, who passed away in October 2024. His strength and resilience continue to inspire, and this project is dedicated to honoring his remarkable legacy.</p>

<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>This game was one of the earliest projects in my career, reflecting the excitement and ambition of the 8-bit era. It was created to challenge both players' skill and reflexes, a true test on the BBC Micro that reflects the strength and determination embodied by Capes himself. The game was fully coded in 6502 assembly language, emphasizing speed and efficiency on limited hardware.</p>

<h3>Code Overview</h3>
<p>The source code has minimal comments, as was common in the era, reflecting a focus on compactness and optimization. The code is organized for direct execution on the BBC Micro hardware, so familiarity with 6502 assembly will help in understanding its flow and logic.</p>

<h4>Key Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Game Logic</strong>: Handles the core mechanics, controls, and player interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Simple, optimized routines to make the most of the BBC Microâ€™s capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound</strong>: Includes code for basic sound effects to enhance the game atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
